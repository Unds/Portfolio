        Hi, my name is Aaron. I am 21 year old student at Massey University studing Creative Media Production. I am currently making up some bullshit for my Portfolio Assesment. If you are reading this what i say is 100% true. i grew up in mainland China till i was 34 years old. I then moved to korea at the age of 25 to become a kpop superstar. That didnt work out. I then moved to Auckland as an infant with my family. It was hardwork keeping the family afloat, i was working 2 jobs at minimum wage. When i wasnt working i was sleeping. There that should be long enough.
